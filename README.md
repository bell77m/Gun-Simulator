# Gun-Simulator

This project is designed to create a custom controller for simulating mouse and keyboard input using an ESP32 microcontroller. The controller incorporates several sensors and input devices that allow for motion-based controls, distance-based actions, and traditional joystick and button interactions. The primary use case seems to be for applications like gaming, where precise and dynamic control is needed.
